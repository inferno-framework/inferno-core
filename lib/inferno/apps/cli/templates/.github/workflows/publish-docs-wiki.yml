# This workflow publishes documentation to the GitHub wiki, which provides a better
# user experience than browsing files in the repository.

# To enable this workflow, you need to first create a GitHub wiki for your repository.

# This workflow will publish the docs to the wiki when a push is made to the
# main branch.  This workflow can also be manually triggered against a PR branch
# as a method to preview updates prior to merge.
