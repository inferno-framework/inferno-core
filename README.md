# Inferno Core

**Inferno Core is currently in alpha status**

Inferno Core is an open source tool for testing data exchanges enabled by the [Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)](http://hl7.org/fhir/) standard. 

## Requirements
Inferno Core requires [Ruby 2.7+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Node.js
and NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

## Running Inferno Core

### Docker
It is recommended that you run Inferno Core via Docker.
```
docker build -t inferno-core .
docker run -p 4567:4567 inferno-core
```

Inferno Core can then be accessed by navigating to
[http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567)

### Natively
```
# Install dependencies
npm install
bundle install

# Start Inferno Core server and UI
npm run dev
```

Inferno Core can then be accessed by navigating to
[http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567)

To only run the server (JSON API with no UI): `bundle exec puma`

## Documentation
Documentation for the JSON API is located in
[docs/swagger.yml](docs/swagger.yml) The contents of this file can be pasted
into the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) for an interactive view.


Documentation for the ruby code can be generated by running `bundle exec
bin/docs`. This documentation will be located in `docs/yard`.

## Running tests via JSON API
With the server running, first retrieve a list of available test suites:
```
GET http://localhost:4567/api/test_suites
```
See the details of a test suite:
```
GET http://localhost:4567/api/test_suites/TEST_SUITE_ID
```
Then create a test session for the suite you want to use:
```
POST http://localhost:4567/api/test_sessions?test_suite_id=TEST_SUITE_ID
```
Tests within a suite are organized in groups. Create a test run to run an entire
suite, a group, or an individual test. Only one of `test_suite_id`,
`test_group_id`, or `test_id` should be provided.
```
POST http://localhost:4567/api/test_runs
{
  "test_session_id": "TEST_SESSION_ID",
  "test_suite_id": "TEST_SUITE_ID",
  "test_group_id": "TEST_GROUP_ID",
  "test_id": "TEST_ID",
  "inputs": [
    {
      "name": "input1",
      "value": "input1 value"
    },
    {
      "name": "input2",
      "value": "input2 value"
    }
  ]
}
```
Then you can view the results of the test run:
```
GET http://localhost:4567/api/test_runs/TEST_RUN_ID/results
or
GET http://localhost:4567/api/test_sessions/TEST_SESSION_ID/results
```

## Development
To get to an interactive console, run `bundle exec bin/console`
